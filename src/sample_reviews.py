Drove an hour and a half to get my lead climbing fix here, and it was WELL worth it!! 
Matt and the rest of the staff were insanely friendly and knowledgeable. 
Especially loved the holiday climbs. Overall, everything was very unique and creative. 
Can't wait to go back again!!

Tried out Basin for the day. Super fun! 
I’m a beginner climber and felt very welcomed right when I walked in. 
I didn’t think the prices were bad at all, especially for all day long. 
I absolutely loved the different skill levels and truly think it’s a place for everyone!

I've never seen such a wildly profit-hungry and user-unfriendly gym (which is insane, coming from a guy that's been to every climbing gym from Central Texas to Houston). 
Not only are the enrollment prices absolutely insane (again, how they're more expensive than KILLEEN climbing gyms, I have no idea), but canceling a membership is like pulling teeth with constant redirection and a refusal to communicate.
